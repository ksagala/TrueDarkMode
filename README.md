## Install
This extension isn't available at the Windows Store (yet), but I'm working on this, so you may consider this as a beta! 

To install this extension you have to enable the "Dev Mode" of Microsoft Edge, to do that, go to about:flags and select "Enable extension developer features", with this enable, go to the three dot menu and select Extension. Click on the Load Extension button and select the folder you saved the download. 

Please, note that, you will not be alerted if a new version come out, unless you follow me on Twitter (@vt_norton) and subscribe to the mail list for new information about this Edge extension! 

## Contribute
This is a totally free open source, and yes, you can help develop it!

To help develop it you won't need much, just one GitHub client for you PC and one Notepad (but if you want to use Visual Studio Code or Formula - Universal Code Editor, I'm not going to be mad).

## Let's put everything on the dark mode
Putting every website on the internet on the dark mode is kinda of impossible, but this doesn't mean that I won't try. This is just a beta version so only a few websites is available, but if you want to help add more websites the source code is opened! And if you don't know how to code but still want to help, you can send feedback to me asking to add new sites. 

If you find any problem, please report it! 

## Guideline

Since this extension is made for Microsoft Edge, please use this tons of shades to make the website darker:

Black 100%: #000000;

Black  80%: #242424;

Black  60%: #383838;

Black  40%: #4C4C4C;


White 100%: #FFFFFF;

White  80%: #D5D5D5;

White  60%: #767676;

White  40%: #D6D6D5;

Use the #000000 background on the content place, where the user will read some text. Other places just use #383838. For the text that is under tthe #000000 background, use #ffffff.

For every site, please create a separate css file and js file (if needed) and put then on the respective folder. Create the file with the name of the website.

You are free to go and to make everything you want!
